/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and allows users to create reports,
 *              but restricts modification and deletion of reports to the report's owner.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, with the document ID matching the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /reports/{reportId}: Stores reports submitted by users. Each report contains a userId field indicating the submitter.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Users can create reports, but only the owner can update or delete them.
 * - Report listing is public, but report modification is restricted to the owner.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The Report entity includes a userId field, which is used to enforce ownership for update and delete operations. This avoids the need for complex queries or additional reads to determine ownership.

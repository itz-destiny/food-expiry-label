/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Shelf Watch application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for reports, where each user can only access their own reports.
 * Image analysis results are publicly accessible but not modifiable. User profiles are private to the respective user.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data. Only the user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /users/{userId}/reports/{reportId}: Stores reports submitted by a specific user. Only the user can read/write their own reports.
 * - /image_analysis_results/{analysisResultId}: Stores the results of image analysis. These are publicly readable, but writes are not allowed in this ruleset.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only manage their own profiles and reports.
 * - Image analysis results are publicly readable, assuming an external process manages their creation.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Reports are stored under the /users/{userId} path, denormalizing the userId into the path itself for easy authorization.
 *   This avoids the need to read the user document to verify ownership.

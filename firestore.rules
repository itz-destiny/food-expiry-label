/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Shelf Watch Firestore database.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes user data ownership and restricts broad access. User documents are private, while submitted reports have public read access but owner-only write access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /reports/{reportId}: Stores user-submitted reports. Anyone can read these reports, but only the submitting user can create, update, or delete them.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to prevent enumeration.
 * - Reports are publicly readable to facilitate data analysis and community review.
 * - Owner-only writes are enforced using the 'userId' field within the report documents.

## Core Features:

- Report Submission: Allow users to submit reports about suspicious food expiry labels, including details such as product name, label description, store location, and photo uploads.
- Image Analysis: Use AI to analyze uploaded images of expiry labels to identify inconsistencies, alterations, or signs of tampering.
- Report Aggregation: Aggregate submitted reports to identify patterns, frequently reported products, or specific store locations with a high incidence of suspicious labels.
- User Feedback and Updates: Provide users with updates on the status of their reports and any actions taken based on their submissions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Fresh green (#90EE90) to convey safety and natural quality.
- Background color: Very light green (#F0FFF0), nearly white to provide a clean and trustworthy backdrop.
- Accent color: A desaturated yellow (#FAFAD2) to highlight important information and CTAs without overwhelming the user.
- Font pairing: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text and 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines. Playfair gives the page a bit of personality without detracting from readability.
- Use clear, simple icons related to food safety and reporting, such as a magnifying glass, an alert symbol, or a food container.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout with a clear hierarchy of information, prioritizing the report submission form and key findings.
- Use subtle animations for form submission confirmations and report updates to enhance user engagement without distracting from the core functionality.
